# About
This notebook is a study on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries">Data Science Job Salaries dataset</a>, containing information on salary, company size and location, remote work, employee location, and many other related to people working in the Data Science field throughout the world.<br><br>

The goal of this notebook is to do an EDA on the data, trying to understand how the feature salary in usd relates to other features and try to understand their relevance when it comes to achieving higher yearly earnings.<br><br>

After doing an EDA, I've used PyCaret regression lib to predict employee salaries in usd according to the features analyzed in the dataset.
